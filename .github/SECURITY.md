# Security Policy

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

### Contacting Us

We value the work of security researchers who help keep our users safe. To responsibly and confidentially disclose vulnerabilities in any of our code, email a report to [security@hash.ai](mailto:security@hash.ai) or use the form at [hash.ai/contact](https://hash.ai/contact).

Please **do not** open a public thread, _Issue_ or _Discussion_ on this or any other of our public GitHub repositories containing any security-related reports as this may put users at risk.

### Bug Bounty

We maintain a bug bounty program that rewards security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities contained within certain HASH-authored code. More information can be found at [hash.ai/security](https://hash.ai/security)

## Support

### Supported Versions

**Security updates are only published for the latest minor version of each of our packages.** We have no expectation of beginning to publish security patches for older versions of our packages in the near future.

### Enterprise Support

If you are an enterprise customer with specific security requirements you can [contact us via the HASH website](https://hash.ai/contact) or email [security@hash.ai](mailto:security@hash.ai)
